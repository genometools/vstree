Compiling and Installing the Vmatch-Sources:

This is a short description of how to compile the 
Vmatch-sources and how to install the compiled
libraries and binaries.

Step 0: Extract

extract the source from the gzipped tar file.

Step 1: SKtools

Install the SKtools in vol/Ccode/SKtools:

- cd Ccode/SKtools
- edit the Makefile 
- i.e. set INSTALLDIR to be the path where the SKtools are to be found
  do not forget to possibly change your PATH variable accordingly
- make

Step 2: DIRVSTREE

setenv DIRVSTREE <the vstree root path>

for example,  I have set

setenv DIRVSTREE /home/skurtz/vol/vstree

in my .tcshrc

extend your PATH variable by 

${DIRVSTREE}/src/vstree/src/bin

in your .tcshrc or you .bashrc depending on what shell you use

rehash (for csh and tcsh)

Step 3: compile

cd ${DIRVSTREE}/src/vstree/src

make

compiles all sources

Step 4: Installing sources

make srcinstall

creates directories 
${DIRVSTREE}/lib
${DIRVSTREE}/include
${DIRVSTREE}/share/doc

and copies appropriate files there.
All programs based on Vmatch suppose that the corresponding
include and library files are in 
${DIRVSTREE}/include and
${DIRVSTREE}/lib

Step 5: Installing binaries

make install

stores the binaries in ${DIRVSTREE}/bin
So you may want to add ${DIRVSTREE}/bin to your PATH and
${DIRVSTREE}/bin/SELECT to LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Step 6: clean

make clean

cleans the objects and all temprary files.

Hope it also works on your machine.

Please do not distribute the sources.
